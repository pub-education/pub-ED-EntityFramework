# Entity Framework

Your assignment is to create an MVC application that connects to a database through Entity Framework. The application in this case is a school app – tracking teachers, students and courses, as well as assignments.


## Required Features:
* Should be able to add students, teachers, courses and assignments through the website
* Should be able to assign students to courses, teachers and
assignments to courses.
* Should be able to print a course and see which assignments are tied
to it, who the teacher is, and who the students are.
* Data should be persistent between executions of the program.

## Code Requirements:
* A database must be created through Entity Framework, and connected to corresponding models in the C# code.
* Sending data to and from the database should be done through an
Entity Framework database context.
* One-to-Many relationships need to be mutual relationships – an object reference on one side, and a list object on the other side.
* Many-to-Many relationships need to be mutual in the C# code in the
same way and be implemented in the database through association tables.
